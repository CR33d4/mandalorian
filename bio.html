    <p id="biodesc">The Mandalorian (Din Djarin) is a widely known and extremely feared bounty hunter. He grew up following the way of the mandalore, and still follows the culture's strict rules. He is seen as cold and ruthless and will do anything to get his job done and to get paid. That is until he comes across Grogu, a child with strong force abilities, and grows to have a deep connection with him. He begins to protect Grogu and love him like his own child. By the end of Djarin's mission , Grogu is given to Luke Skywalker to be trained as a jedi, as a loving gesture Djarin talks off his helmet to show Grogu his real face for the first time, before saying goodbye. Months later, Grogu then decides to leave the jedi training, and come back to Din Djarin to live and grow up with him as his father. </p>
